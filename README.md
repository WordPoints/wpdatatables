# wpDataTables [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WordPoints/wpdatatables.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WordPoints/wpdatatables)

Hello! This is where we develop the premium [wpDataTables](http://wpdatatables.com) integration module that you can [purchase on WordPoints.org](https://wordpoints.org/modules/wpdatatables/). The source code of the module is made available here in good faith, to make it easier for developers to integrate with it, contribute bugfixes and security patches, and follow the development of new features. You can also feel free to use this source code to try the module out before you buy it. However, if you decide to use the module on a production site, we ask that you [purchase a license for it](https://wordpoints.org/modules/wpdatatables/), so that we can continue to provide updates and support for WordPoints and all of its great modules. Thank you!
